# Project Lumen

Project Lumen is clean modern, Windows-like operating System built from scratch entirely with custom (No linux or BSD).
The goal is provide a familar desktop experince that is fast, lightweight, ultitises modern techologies and it is free from bloat, ads and telemtry etc. Project Lumen is designed to be as single OS - NOT A COLLECTION OF DISTROS**. Aims to provide official experience and a clear product vision.

## Why Project Lumen Exists

As you know modern desktop operating systems having become increasingly complex and cluttered:

- Forced background application and services
- Advertisements and telemtry
- Inconsistent user experience
- Heavy background processes
- Limited control over system behaviour
- Heavy built in AI services such as Copilot

Project Lumen aims to explore different approach:
A desktop OS that priotises:
- Performance and responsive scaled across CPUs with more cores
- Simplicity and clarity
- User choice
- Security without scarifing freedom
- A consistent and customisable UI.
- More options in the settings.
- Privacy in mind e.g. microphone or camera access.

 ## Core Principles 
Project Lumen is not a distrubed-based system!
Only one official OS build with controlled updates, a single desktop environment and a unified design language.
No fragmentation and No distro variants.
Apps are like Windows, but drivers are controlled like macOS.
